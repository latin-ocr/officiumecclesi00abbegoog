xvi PREFA CE.

drawn up before the time of Abbot John de Brokehampton. lt
appears from the Chronicle that before the time of this Abbot
some at least ol the conversi, or lay-brothers, were allowed to live
outside the monastery, settled at the manors in the Vale of
Evesham which belonged to the Abbey: and that he introduced
or first enforced the rule that all conversi should be inmates ol the
monastery. In the directions as to the burial of the conversi
it seems to be taken as a matter ol course that a conversus
would be resident in the monastery at the time of his decease, a
state ol things which would not, according to the Chronicle,
have existed before this Abbot's regulation. The fact that the
services contained in this third portion of the book have been
revised and arranged for use at Evesham is shown by the
occurrence in the litanies of the names ol St ngin‚ andos two
other saints St Odulf and St Credan, who were locally venerated
at Evesham, aud also by the mention ol particular altars, which
indicates adaptatioh t'o the arrangements of a particular house.

In reproducing 'the text of the Evesham book, the spelling of
the MS. has been preserved throughout, the alterations and
ι corrections of later hands being noted where they occur. Con-

tracted syllables have in all cases been expanded in accordance
with the form which the same syllables take when written out

at length. In cases where words are abbreviated, and there is
a doubt as to the word intended, the abbreviated lorm has been
preserved. The “obelus ” hasbeen employed to mark readings
which are clearly due to a blunder either of the scribe, or of the
earlier scribe whose work he may have copied, and also, in one
or two cases, to indicate that what looks like a blunder is the
actual reading of the MS. The text has been carefully revised,
andI hope that the errors due to my own transcription, or to
faults ol printing, have been reduced to a very small number:
that such errors are altogether banished, l can hardly venture
to believe. The general character of the spelling shows no
remarkable variation from the current usage ol the time when the
MS. was written: there is the usual amount of uncertainty asto the
spelling of particular words.l

¹ Two points· ol this kind perhaps call ior special mention: (r) The use of sc as
equivalent to s at the beginning os a word (e. g. scandali: lor sandaliis, in several places3
scicicnti for sitienti in col. 95, l. 21), and (2) the frequency ol the use of ti for ci (eg.
fatiens sor faciens).
