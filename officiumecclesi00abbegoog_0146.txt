persons at the Abbot’ s mnundy were always twelve. The Evesham
book gives the number thirteen: this may he a slip us the scribe,
but may, on the other hand, have heen intended to con-espond
with the whole number of those who were present at the Last
Supper. Thirteen was also the number in the Prior’s maundy at
Durham (Ritus osDnrham, p. ⁵5). The aula where the ceremony
took place vas perhaps the hall of the Abhot's lodging. The
Prior's maundy at Durham and the Abbot's maundy at Westmins
ter were performed in the cloister, but at a spot different from that
of the monks' maundy. The Concordia Regularis and Lanfrnne's
statuta both place the ¹¹ mandatum fratrum ” immediately after the
