mentioned before 1281, occurs but seldom after that date, except in the
list of vestments given by william stowe. Yellow (nouus) only appears .
once, and then as the colour of flowers upon a violet chasuble. The tenu
stragulata (which may apparently mean either ‘¹ embroidered '¹ ot “ striped '¹)
is applied once before 1²²9 as the epithet os a set of white vestmenu, and
again between ¹345 and 1367 apparently as the description of several
vestments (the colour os whichis not otherwise described) acquired by
Abbnt William Boys, whose taste in the matter os ornament seems to bave
been slightly florid. The term cypreus applied to a set of vestments ior a
priest perhaps denotes n fabric rather than a colonr: but the vestments in
question were apparently not suited for the service os the church os Eveshsni,
and were bestowed upon one John Golasre, perhaps the priest serving one
os the churches os the Vale, which were dependencies os the Monaetery.
Ash-eolour (a'nertus) only occurs once, the date being uncertain.

The amaran ΜΞ. ³⁷⁶³ contains a note whiehthmwssnme ugia on the
use uf Eveshnm in the matter of colours for particular days. The portion
of the MS. in which the note occurs is of the reign os Richard 11, or the
latter part of the reign οἱ Edward 111.

'‘Memomnduni quod consuetudo istius ecclesiae est in omnibus festis
halae Mariae uti album venarentur-n, In vigiliis omnium sanctorum et
nat. dornini et in cena domini et vigiliis pasche et pentecostes rubeis. Die
natalis domiui utendum est magua nigra casula ad magnam missam eodem
die ad missam in galli cantu et die pasche ad magnam missam et die
ascensionis et die pentecostes alba casula deasperata et auro stragulata
utendum est. In [esto sancti ngini et in die animarum et in anniversariis
suncti Uulsini et Regum minore nigra casula utendum est.”

In this unte the most remarkable point is the direction to use “the
great black chasuble ” at high mass on Christrnas Day. Perhaps this is
to be connected with Canute’s gift of “the better black chasublel' The
choice of colour was perhaps due, in part at least, to the splendour os the
vesti-nent, and it is likely that Canute¹s gift may have been sor some time
the finest vestment in the possession of the monastery. On the subject
o( this sequence os colours at Christmas, Dr. Wickharn Legg has kindly
furnished the note which follows this appendix⁴ The use of ¹* the lesser
black chasuble ¹¹ on the anniversaries of S‘ ngin, S* Wlsiri, and the Kings
(athenea, Kemed, and effa), was probably (so far as the enimn is ωη-
cerned) an instance os the use os blank sor feasts of eonfessors,¹ which may
have had its origin in the first anniversaries uf those who were afterwards
esteemed as saints. The white chasuble used at high mass on Easter
Day, Ascension Day, and Pentecost, and ror :he mass in galli cam on
Christmas Day, may apparently be identified with one acquired, together
with a cope ot the sanie designv by Abbor Randols, between 1214 and
1229v The use of white sor Whitsunday may be noticed.
