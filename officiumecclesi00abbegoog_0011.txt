to the nature of the book, which appears to have been primarily
ι intended for the use of the Abbot of Westminster, though some
offices which it contains are evidently sor the use ol a bishop only.
The Dean of Carlisle includes the Westminster book in the list of
English and Scottish Pontificals prefixed to his edition of the
Pontifical of Christopher Bainbridge. He calls ita “ Pontifical of
an Abbot of Westminster,'’ and remarks concerning it, “This is
the only remaining Abbatial Pontifical of which l arn aware.’'l

To the Westminster book, it seems most likely that the title of
“Pontifical'’ was actually applied. Dr. Wiclrham Legg, in the
preface to the first volume of his edition of the Westminster
Missal,2 pointed out that the first words of its second folio corres-
pond with those os a “ pontifical '’ mentioned in the inventory os
1540. The evidence of the Westminster book itself would rather
suggest the name of “Benedictionarium,” since more than one
marginal note in the MS. refers to “another Benedictionarium’'
for matters not sully or correctly contained in the text.

But the Westminster book does not exactly correspond with
the Evesham book as to the nature of its contents, and neither the
name “ Pontifical'’ nor the name “Benedictionarium’' seems to
apply so well to the Evesham book as to the kindred book os
Westminster. The presence os certain offices lor use by a bishop
may perhaps be held to entitle the latter to the name of a Ponti·
fical, using that name in its more ordinary sense. The presence of
a series of episcopal benedictions sor use in the service of the
mass may perhaps have been the reason sor its being called a
“Benedictionarium,'’ if that name is not simply equivalent to
“ Pontifical.” The Evesham book, on the other hand, is through·
out an Abbot’s book: the person who is supposed to perform the
offices which it contains is the Abbot, or the Prior, or some other
priest acting for the Abbot; it contains no episcopal offices. Nor
does it contain any series of benedictions sor use at mass similar
to the series in the Westminster book. These benedictions do not
appear to have been in use at Evesham: sor the directions as to
the mass when the Abbot celebrated do not mention any bene-
diction as given by him at the point where the episcopal bene-
diction was given, but provide sor his giving, at the end of the
