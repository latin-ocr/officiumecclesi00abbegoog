158 APPENDJXI.

Adesto domine supplicacionibus nostris et uiam famuli tui
[principis nostri Henrici1] in salutis tue prosperitate dispone: ut
inter omnes uie et uite huius uarietates tuo semper protegatur
auxilio. Per. Saluum fac seruum tuum. Mitte ei domine auxilium
de sancto

The recto of the fourth leaf contains aform by which the Abbot
of Evesham releases from the sentence of greater excommunication
a monk of the same house. The name of the monk is only in·
dicated by the letter N, while the offence by which the sentence
had been incurred is specified. From this it may be inferred that
several monks had been concerned in the same offence‚ an asseruit,
namely, upon Master John, Rector of the church of Hinton,
probably Hinton on the Green in Gloucestershire‚ about two miles
from Evesham. The form is in a hand of about the middle of the
14th century, and the Abbot for whose use it was written must
therefore have been either Abbot William de Chyryton (1316-44)
or Abbot William Boys (1345-67).

ln dei nomine amen. Nos frater Willelmus permissione diuina
Abbas eueshamie te fratrem N. commonachum nostrum monasterii
eiusdem a sentencia excommunicationis maioris. [qua]² propter
tuam uiolentam manuum iniectionem nuper infra monasterium nos-
trum scienter in casu a iure non permisso in magistrum Iohannem
Rectorem ecclesie de Hynton clericum innodatus existis quam -
consideratis omnibus in hac parte iuste considerandis non atrocem
sed leuem fuisse et esse iniuriam arbitramur: absoluimus et te
restituimus ecclesiasticis sacramentis³ ln nomine patris. et filii:
et spiritus sancti Amen.

On the verso of the fourth leaf follows a form apparently
intended for the benediction of some person or persons on a
journey. It is in a hand of the15th century. Spaces have been
left for ornamental initial letters, but the letters which were in-
tended to be added have been written in the spaces in asmall hand.

¹ The words in brackets are apparently written over an erasure, and have been
themselves partly scored through and blotted.

² qua has been erased before propter, no doubt by mistalre.
⁸ cum penitencia tibi iniuncta interlined in another hand.
