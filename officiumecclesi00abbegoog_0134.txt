l. 28* Deus infinite mism'cordie. This ίτι the Sarum Mnnual is one of
the benedictione at the mass: in the Westminster book it precedes
the delivery of the staff und scrip.

Col. 50. l. π. Deus inuicte potentie. This is the sur-m of benedictina
of the eroes in the Sarum Manual, where the cross is delivered
with the first of the two forms given in the Evesham book.

L 26. Accipe signum inuincibile. Neither this for-m of delivery
nor the benediction following itis given in the Sarum Manunl.

L 37‚ Omnipotens sempiterne drus. See note on col. 48, 1. 17.

1. 40. Benedictio κωμικὴ. This form differs slightly cmm that given
in elsae {Tum anlr, and Herelord books sor the blessing of bread
on un ys.

Col. 51.1, 6. Benedictio mmor-um pomorum pirorum. This very nesrly
agrees with a “ Benedictio Pomorum ¹’ in the York Manual. The
addition of the word ³ pirorum '³ shows that at the time when the
book was written pears were of sufficient importanee as a local erup
to receive special mention*

l. ¹3- Benedfflio unarum. The benedictiun appears more than
once with slight variatim-is in the Gelasiau aud Gregoxizm Sacra-¹
mentaries ; but the insertion uf {he words “et maturos '¹ is unusual.
There were vineyards belonging to the monastery ar Eveshani, the
first os which seems to have been planted by Abbot Walter (1077⁴85).
(See Clmmv ΑΜ. ιιι Emh. p. 97.)

1. ²4- Beneditlianes ad mamma ιιι-[επὶ benedicenda. It is nor
quite clear at what time the Abbots os Evesham first claimed
authority t'or blessing sacerdotal vestrnents. In the Cotton MS.
Vespasian E. XXlV. there appears a bull (printed in Monast. Anglia
Vol. 11. p. ¹9) from Pope Clement to Abbot Roger, dated vi. Id. ,
Jui {n the second year of the rope. This is followed by another
bull frorn Clement to Roget, dated viii. Kal< Feb. in the fourth
year os the Pope, giving the sanie privileges conferred by the
former bull to the Abbot aad llis succcssorr, and this hy a third
buu, from Pope celestine m Abbot Roger, dated Id. Jan. in
the first year ol the Pope, in the same terms as the last, hut with
the addition of :m anathema against any one who may infringe
the concession. In MS< Harl. 3763,1here is a similar series of
bulls: but in this MS. while the second and third agree with
the copies in the Cotton MS, the first of the series is addressed
to Abbot Adam, and in it, though the words “necnon et vesti-
menta sacerdotalia benedicendi” have been written, they are
marked, as though sor omission, hy dots under the line. In
the Chronicle of Evesham (pp. 178>9) the hull of Pope Clement
to Ahbor Adam is given. without these words, and is followed
by the bull of Pope Celestine to Abhot Roger, while no hull
from Pope Clement to Abhot Roger appears at all. The first
Abbot Roget succeeded in 1159 and died in 1160 (θάνοι Ahh.
dt Evesll⁴ p. 100, notes). Itis therefore impossible that he could
have received any privileges (as is suggested in Monast. Anglic.
