206 NOTES.

Col. 125. l. 5. Commendationem. The rubric of the Westminster
book seems to include “Proficiscere anima christiana '' under
the term “commendatio'’ Lanfranc's Statura and the Eves-
ham rubric treat the “commendatio '' as a separate office,
beginning with the prayer “Tibi domine commendamus.'' The
Statura direct that the body is to be removed after this prayer
has been said: according to the Evesham mbrics it would
be removed before it ; that prayer, with the rest of the com·
mendation, being said in the chapel of the infirmary. The order
of the commendation, except for the difference already noted,
is almost exactly the same in the Westminster and Evesham books.

Col. 129.l.1. Cum doc completa ficerr'ot, etc. The Westminster book
has no direction as to the saying of “ Dirige ’' and “Placeb0,'’
but proceeds after the commendation, to speak of the order
which is to be followed when the brethren go to meet dre body
and bring it to the church. This course seems to be that con-
templated also in Lanfranc's Statura. At Evesham, apparently,
the body was brought to the chapel of the infirmary, and the
brethren, after “Dirige'’ and “Phoebo'' had been said in that
chapel, went in procession wrth the body frorn the chapel to the
great church. The precise arrangements followed in each monas·
tery no doubt depended to some extent on the relative position
of different parts of the buildings.

Col. 13& lA4. fillum ibi quod est. This was an altar of St Michael.
ee pp. .

l. 18. Sosczjoo domine. This and the following prayer are given in
the Westminster book to be used when the procession meets the
body on its way to the church. (See note on col. 129, l. Ι.)

l. 30. Ante altore beati rodonm's. Probably the altar of St John
Baptist, between the door of the choir and the entrance to the

crypt. (See note on col. 57. l. 30.)

Col. 131. l. 26. Secundum tameo, etc. The directions for watching by
the body agree generally with those of Lanfranc's Statura. The
Westminster book gives no directions on the point, proceeding at
once with the order of burial.

Col.132.l.27. Omnes fratres dricrjolioom recipiant pro defuncto. This
direction is not contained in the Concordia Reguloris or in Lanfranc's
Statura. The nearest parallel to itin Martene's de Ant. Mon.
Rr't. seems to be in a passage cited from St Peter Damiani.
(Lib. V. cap. xiii. p. 273). “Cum frater quispiam ex nostris obierit
. . . pro eo unusquisque septem dies jejunat, septem discip-
linas curn millenis scoparum ictibus accipit,'' etc. The rule at
Evesham seems to have been 'rather less stringent.

Col. 133. l. 12. Circumdederunt me. The Westminster book has not
this anthem, substituting for it the responds: “Subvenite sancti
dei'’ and “Libera me,'' followed by a collect. Except for this
variation, and for some to be afterwards noted, it may be said
