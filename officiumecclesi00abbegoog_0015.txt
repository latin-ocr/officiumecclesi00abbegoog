expended on the arrangement os new service books between the
date of Celestine’s grant and that of Roger Norreys’ deposition in

1213. Not long after the latter event, we learn from the Chronicle
of Evesham of the formation of a book, the contents of which in
part correspond with the second of the three sections of the
Evesham book.

This was the work of Thomas de Marleberge, the champion of
the monks of Evesham in their contest with the Abbot, and of the
monastery in its contest with the Bishop of Worcester. It was
apparently while he held the office of Prior, under Abbot Randolf,
the successoros Roger Norreys‚ that Thomas, “de grossa litera
librum de ordine officii abbatis a Purificatione sanctae Mariae usque
· ad Pentecosten, et de professione monachorum, et lectiones de
Pascha et Pentecoste fecit scribi et ordinavit in uno volumine ;
item in alio praedictum officium, quod officium non prius erat
ordinate scriptum apud nos”l An entry in the Cotton MS.
Vespasian B. XXIV. cited by Mr. Macray, in a note on this
passage, in his edition of the Chronicle, gives the same informa-
tion with a slight variation :—“ Praeterea librum de ordine officii
Abbatis a Purificatione sanctae Mariae usque ad sanctum Pascha,
et lectiones de Pascha et Pentecoste et de benedictione fontium
baptismatis et de professione monachorum in uno volumine de
grossa litera fecit, et in alio de graciliori litera, quae omnia non
erant prius scripta apud nos ordinate.” Three points of difference
between the two accounts seem to call sor notice.

(1) The Chronicle states that the Ordo officii in the volume
“de grossa litera'’ included Pentecost, while the Cotton MS.
speaks as though it had ended at Easter. The difference is pro-
bably unimportant, for it is quite possible that the same ordo
might be described in either way. The corresponding section of
the Evesham book, sor instance, gives details as to the ceremonies
ol Easter, and concludes them with a direction that the same rules
are to apply to Pentecost

(2) The Cotton MS. makes special mention of the ordo “de
, benedictione fontium baptismatis'’ This difference also is pro-
bably of slight importance : since one writer might consider this
ceremonial to be included under the general mention oi the officium
