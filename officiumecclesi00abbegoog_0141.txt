194 moras,

deacon advancing by degrees from the altar through the presbytery‚
and the deacon with the penitents retiring before him by degrees
frorn the presbytery through the choir and so to the church door.

Col. 67. l. 19. Altam sancta ammi. Probably that made “in navi eccle-
siae '’ by Thomas de Marleberge, when Abbot, c. 12 32· (Claram.
Aba. de Evesh. p. 276.)

l. 22. Dacanus. The “Decanus Christianitatis '² who exercised
jurisdicti0n‚ by the appointment of the monastery, over the subject
churches of the Vale of Evesham. At Westminster the Archdeacon
discharged the function here assigned to the Dean, and himself
ejected the penitents, if the Abbot was not present.

l. 28. Cor mundum. This anthem is not appointed in any of the
three Missals or in the Westminster book.

l. 31. The S. before Amen most probably stands for “ seculorum‚'’ ia.
the last word of Gloria patri (ree eol. 14, l. 9.) The same abbre-
viationappears again in col. 126, l. 7.

1. 38. Domr'm'ca in ramispalmarum. The order for the benedictfon
of the palms and the procession given in the text differs from the
parallel orders in the Sarum, York, and Hereford Missah, and in
the Westminster book. So faras the prayers for the blessing of
the palms are concerned‚ it resembles that in the Sarum Missal
rather than the others: but this portion still more closely resembles
the parallel section in the Magdalcn Pontifical. The order of the
procession‚ of course, varied according to local conditions.

l. 39. Canamtur aa orrttplrone. These anthems are mentioned also in
the Westminster book.

Col. 68. l. 6. Et dalmatica. The Westminster rubric notes that the
deacon does not wear a dalmatic if the Abbot is not present.

l. 8. Paneas euangelmm super analogiam. The Westminster book
directs that before the Gospel is read a subdeacon isto read the
lesson from the book of Exodus which appears, with slight variation‚
in the three Missals. The Westminster rubric lays especial stress
upon this point, as one sometimes neglected :-“ Que quidem leccio
uetus significat testamentum et tamen aliquociens in modernis
temporibus legi non consueuit. licet in quampluribus huius ecclesie
missalibus scribatur atque in basilicis cathedralibus necnon et
in ecclesiis que magne sunt auctoritatis uniuersaliter legatur.'’

l. 13. Legat euangelium festiue. The'Westminster book directs that
the Gospel is to be read ‘⁸ nota cotidiana.'’ The passage to be read
for the Gospel is not specified in the Evesham book. That which
the Westminster book indicates is the same which is given in the
Sarum and York Missals‚ and it is mentioned also in the Concordia
Regularis and in Lanfranc's statuta. (See Reyner, Apost. Banad.

⁴ in Angl. App. pp. 86, 217.)

1.17. Exora'zotecreatura florum. This exorcism is omitted in the
York and Hereford Missals‚ and in the Westminster book. It
appears in the Sarum Missal and in the Magdalen Pontifical. '
