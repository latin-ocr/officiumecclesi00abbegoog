PREFA ΟΕ. nii

The punctuation uf the MS. has also been reproduced, so far as
appeared to be praeticable. Except in a few cases, no notice has
been taken us stops inserted by later hand& The original scribe
used four signs of punctuation: (a) the single point, having
sometimes the value of a full stop, sometimes the value of a
modern comma: (h) a point surmounted by a curve: (c) a
horizontal curved line: (d) a note of interrogation. The relative
value os (b) and (c) and of (a) in its lesser significance, seems to
be quite uncertain: but (b) generally appears to mark a rather
longer pause than the other two. The simple point and the
interrogation mark have been retained, while (b) is expressed by
the colon, and (c) which appears practically equivalent to the lesser
value of (a) by the simple point.

The musical notation which occurs at several points of the
MS. presents, so far as I am aware, no features of special interest:
its presence has been indicated by the suot-notes wherever it
occurs.

The portioris of the MS. (other than initia! letters) which are
written in colour, are printed in italic type ς the colour ordinarily
employed is red: some headings are written in blue, and a few
in green, apparently in green ink: but these points do not seem
to be of such importance as to require notice in every case·
The initial letters are, as a rule, alternately in red and blue.
green not being used for single letters: where the initials
are omamented, the ornament is always slight, and osa common
type.

The matter contained in the leaves which now stand before
the first page of the Evesham book, and which probably formed
part of the same volume with it before it came into Earlow's
hands, has been printed in the sust section of the Appendix.
The two offices which appear in this place may clearly, from
internal evidence, be assigned to Evesham. This appears, in
regard to the office for the Installation os the Abbot, from the
mention of the Abbot's manor os Offeham or Offenham, and of
the Church of All Saints within the Abbey precinct; and in
regard to the order sor admitting to confraternity, from the
mention os S¹ Mary and 8¹ ngin in the address made to the
person admitted. The form of absolutinn which appears on a
later leaf was also evidently intended for use at Evesham. With
