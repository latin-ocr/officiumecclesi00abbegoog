l. 16. In sestis caporum. So sar as the purposes of the Evesham
book are concerned, the festivals not differentiated as “septem
festa,'’ or as “festa curn solemni processione,’' were divided into
“festa caparum '’ (also called “ festa in capis ”) and “festa in albis.'’
The masses on these days are accordingly spoken os as “missae in
capis ’' or “missae in albis ”; see l. 22, and col. 16, l. 9.

l. 24· T'eneat charum. According to Ducange (s. v. tenere), this
phrase may be apparently interpreted either as equivalent to “regat
chorum‚’' or as signisying that the Abbot was to “keep choir‚” i.e.,
to be present at the service in his place in the choir, not privately
in some other part of the church, or in some room adjoining it.

1. 30. Mum'tcrgr'um. Probably in this place simplya “towel'' ; but
see note on col. 2, l. 21, and compare col. 7, l. 34, sqq.

l. 31. Pecten. The ritual use of the comb seems to have ‚formed part
of the ceremonral washing in the caseos all English prelates. Its

use by Bishops is attested as lateas the 16th century by the Ponti-
fical oi Christopher Bainbridge. (Surtees Society, Vol. 61, p. 3.)
The comb was used also by the King at his coronation3 Charles I.
as appears from a note of Abp. Laud, “ caled to see y⁸ combe and
vsed it.'’ (Coronotrbn of King Charles I. Henry Bradshaw Society,
p. 35, note.) Ware’s Consuetudinary attests its use by the
Abbot oi Westminster. <Cotton MS.‚ Otho C. XI. f. 29.)

Col. a. l. 1. Pulsetur classicum cum omnr'bussigm‘s. The “classicum ''
was a ringing of several belis (or, as here, of the whole number)
not, apparently, in the manner os a “ peal,'’ but all together.¹ The
Chronicle preserves poure details as to the bells oi the monastery.
Abbot Reginald (1122-49) made two bells which were known as
“ Benedict and his fellow.''² Abbot Adam (1160-91) made “duas

maximas campanas,” which were apparently known as “ Jesus ’' and
“ Gloriosa.’' AbbotWilliam Boys (1345—67) made “duas magnas
campanas Mariam scilicet et ngynum, quas venerabilis pater
archiepiscopus Nazarenus chrismate sacro linivit.'' Another bell
was known as “Gratia’' (cleron. Abb. de Eveslr. pp. 99, roo,

or)
i. 3. Superius. By the upper door, ie. that entering from the aisle.

l. 6.s gd εἶιίζιυη suum inferius. To the stall south of the west door

l. 9. (guarello. Quarellus is explained by Ducange to mean a
cus ron.

olher purposes, and would not be reckoned among the ‘¹ signa''
