is unlikely, is a Lady-ehapel already existed in his time in the uppen-
chureh, that he would have proceeded to undertake the building
os another. That the Lariy-chapel should be situated in the crypt
may have been nn unusual arrangement, but is certainly not in
itself ineredible. The nhapel os S'. Mary Undercroft at Canter-
bury surnishes an instance os such a came: and the sarne chumh
supplies an instance of a later lady—chapel being built in addition
to that in the undererost- The crypt at Evesham appears,
from Mr. Rudge’s investigatione, to have been of considerable
height internally. The remnins ot its western wall were still
visuale, and rose to a height of more than uiue feet [rom the level
of its floor, without showing any trane of the vaulting. 1t seems
not impossible that the east end of the crypt (which was divided by
four rows os pillars) projected beyond the east end os the supere
structure. and that the ¹· quinque tem cryptarum ¹¹ repaired by
Thomas de Marleberge may be explained ns the ruofs of the five divi-
sions οἱ this projection os the crypt, which would probably share to
some extent in the min of the presbytery. From Martene (dc Ant.
Man. πίε. Lin 111. cap. vii. p. ως) ix would appear that the omer
Benedictine usage with regard to the blessing of the candies was
that it should take place “extra propriam ecclesiam' or, if in the
chuxch, in some chapel within it, tn which a processior-i was made.
He cites sever-al instantes of the performance o( the rite in the
Ladyziiapei, among niem being Cluui, imm which place, perhaps,
the usage may have been introduced nt Evesharuy through the
former connection of Abbot Adai-n (1187-91) with the Cluniae
house of CharitesurALoire. But i( the Lady-chapel were not in the
crypt, the usage os hlessing the mndles in that part os the church
will simply be an additional instance nf the local variation noted
by Matiene. The alus of ε’ John nuptia mentioned in iiie mbric
apparently stood near the western door of the cheir, and sufficiently
neas to the preshytery for the roos above it to require restoration

aster the fall of the tower. (See the passages [rom the Chronicie
cited above.)

l. 30. Celebrans mii-sam semper deserar candelam, etc. Martene cites a
similar direction {rom the eustolus of the Eenedictine house os
Notre-Dame de Lyre. According to the usage of Bec, which be
also cites, the taper was held until the offertory, and then set on a
mndlesnck *¹ in dextra purte aitaris ” until near the end of the mass.
(οι Ant. Man, ιω. Lib. 111. αιμ vii. p. μη.) The passage from the
customs of NotreVDame de Lyre shows at what points the celebrant
would be relieved of the taper.
