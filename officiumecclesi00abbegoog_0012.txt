mass, a solemn benedict-ion in one fixed form. Thus, while the
general character of the book corresponds with that os the West-
minster '¹ Pontifical '’ or ‘¹ Benedictionarium,'' it seems to lack the
features which caused the Westrninster book to be known hy either
os these namen.

The heading os the book itselt' might perhaps be held to show
the name by which it should be known : and in the present edition
it has been adopted as a formal title. But it may perhaps be
doubtful, as will presently appear, whether this heading was
originally intended to cover the whole book; it seems perhaps
most likely that it applied, at least ln an especial degree, to «he
first and second portioris os its contents. In any case, the title is
too long and too cumbrous for frequent repetition : and a shortened
[orm of it could hardly be less vague than the name by which it ,
has been thought most convenient to denote the book sor the
purpose os this presace, and os the notes appended to the text.

The Evesham book is among the manuscripts which were left,
in 1691, by Thomas Barlow, Bishop os Lincoln, to the Library of
the University of Oxford, over which, as Bodley's Librarian, he
had presided from 1652 to 166o From a note in Earlow's own
handwriting, it appears that he became possessed os the book in
or before the year 1651 ·, but there is nothing to show whence he
obtained it. Its contents, however, give ample evidence of the fact
that it was intended sor use in the Benedictine monastery os St
Mary and S¹ ngin at Evesham in Worcestershirel

The manuscript is now known in the Bodleian Library as ΜΒ,
Barlow 7. lt is written in a rather large and elea-r hand os about
the year 1300, and consists (apart from certain unnurnbered leaves
at the beginning,¹ and a leaf at the end¹) of 136 leaves, each of
which, as a rule, contains 18 lines, The size os the leaves may be
stated in inches, as izi by δῇ, or in millimetres as 322 by 212.
The leaves have been numbered (apparently in Barlow's hand-
writing) by pages, the numbers running from 1 to 272, including
one blank page, numbered 184. The recto of the last leaf, the
contents os which are not part of the original MS„ is numbered
273. The leaves are arranged in 13 gatherings, which are not num-
bered z but with three exceptions the last page of each gathering
