p. 154. l. 26. Offilium. Thiswasoneoi the most ancient possessions of
the monastery oi Evesham‚ on which it was bestowed, according
to one account, by Ethelred os Mercia,¹ καθὼς to another, by
ora, according to a third, by Kenred oi Mercia and Ossa,
“governor os the East Anglea' Tm first statement is that ol the'
Harleian MS. 3763, tbe second that os the Chronicle (p. 71).
the third depeuds upon a charter of Kenred and offa contained
in the Cotton MS. Vespasian, B. XXIV, which is, however, marked
as suspected by Kemble in his Codex Drplomaticus (Vol. I, p. 70).
The name of the place is speltin various ways' in the Chronicle
and other records of the monastery: the modern torm “Offen-
ham⁷’ is perhaps the most usual. The manor os Offenham lay
to the northeast of Evesham‚ on the left bank of the Avon.
There was a grange there, built by Abbot Adam (noo-91), who
also enclosed a deer-park on the manor, afterwards enlarged by
Abbot Norton (1483-91). It was to Offenham that Abbot
Clement Lichfield retired on his resignation in 1539: after that
event, when his successor, Philip Hawford, had tulfilled the con-
ditions os his appointment by surrendering the monastery to the
King, the manor was granted, with most os the Abbey lands, to
Philip Hoby. The Abbot, ii he came from Offenham, would
have to ride about three mileS, entering Evesham through Benge- .
worth, and crossing the Avon by the bridge at the entry os the
town. He would then pass along Bridge Street to the north os the
Abbey precincts. >

l. 28. Aa portam cimiterii. This is probablya gate which still
remains, by which the present parish churchyard and church of
All Saints are approached from the marketplace. Entering the
cemetery (which apparently included the present churchyards of
All Saints and St Laurence), he would come at once to the
church of All Saints But it is possible that he might have
passed by this gate, going on through the market-place, and
turning to the leit by the continuation os the High Street (now
called Vine Street) towards Merstowe Green, so entering the
cemetery bya western gate. In this case, however, the distance
from the gate to All Saints' church would be longer, and he
would have had to pass by the church of St Laurence on the way.

l. 32· Ecclesium omnium sanctorum. This church is still in exis-
tence, lying to the north of the site of the great church, and
about fifty yards from it. Its western porch is close to the north
gate of the churchyard (see last note), and would be nearly
opposite to the north door of the nave of the great church.

l. 21. Require super textum in fine. The reference is to the end of
the “textus’' or book of the Gospels, already mentioned, where
the prayer was no doubt written at length.
