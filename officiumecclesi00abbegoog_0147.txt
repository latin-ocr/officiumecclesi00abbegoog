200 NOTES.

l. 31. Die parasceue. The Westminster book contains nothing con-
cerning the Good Friday ceremonial. See note on col. 83, l. 10.

l. 38. Eant in capitulum. According to Lanfranc’s Statura (Reyner,
mg. ἕξὲῖέῐὴι Angl, App. p. 222) the psalter was said through

Col. 88. l. 5. Eunt in criptis ac disciplinas sumant. There is no refer-
ence to this usage in the Concordia Regulart's, or in Lanfranc’s
Statuta. Martene (de Ant. Mon. Rit. Lib. ΙΙΙ. cap. xiv. p. 135)
cites two similar instances, one being from Croyland. But in both
the cases he mentions the discipline was received in the Chapter·
house.

Col. 89. l. 29. quucad Pax domim, etc. From Martene (de Ant. Mon.
Rit. Lib. III. cap. xiv. pp. 139-40) it appears that there was a
diversity of usage as to saying or not saying “Pax Domini.” The
alteration in the Evesham rubic perhaps points to a local change
of practice after the date when the MS. was first written.

Col. 90. l. 22. Reuestiantur albis. The Westminster rubric has “toto
conuentu reuestit0.'' The Westminster book has much more
detailed directions than are given in the Evesham rubrics as to
the processions‚ and places here the “Benedictio ignis,'’ joining it,
as in the Sarum, York, and Hereford Missals, with the “Benedictio
cerei” and placing after it a benediction of incense closely correspond-

Α ing with that which the Evesham book directs to be used during the

singing of “Exulet'' The rubrics concermng the “Benedictio
cerei '' in the Westminster book, though fuller than the Evesham
rubrica are apparently incomplete, as a note is added, stating that
the subject is better and more fully treated “ in alio benediction-
ario.’'

before it the “Ordo ad faciendum catechumenum,’' which in the
Evesham book is placed apart from the “ Benedictio fontis.'' With
regard to the usage of blessing the font at Evesham, it may be
noted that during the proceedings before Innocent III. at Rome,

on the question of the authority of the monastery over the churches

, of the Vale, in 1206, Thomas de Marleberge, on behalf of the
monastery, argued that the “chapels '' of the Vale must be exempt
from the Bishop of Worcester, since the “mother church'' was
exempt. This was met by the statement that the churches of the
Vale were not “cherpen’' but “ecclesiae baptismales‚'' while there
was no baptismal font in the Abbey church: and the fact was
admitted by Thomas de Marleberge, in answer to a direct question
from the Pope. The time when a font was introduced into the
Abbey church is not stated: but its introduction was perhaps a
consequence of this argument, and it had evidently taken place
before the death of John de Brokehampton, who was buried in
1316 “juxta fontem in navi ecclesiae'’ (Chron. Abb. de Eoesh.

pp. 185, 289).
