NOTES.

Volll. p.4) from Pope Clement III.wh0 was elected in December,
1187. Abbot Adam succeeded Roger, and died Nov.12th, 1191,
(Ceron. Abb. de Evesh. p. 102, note) being succeeded by Roger
Norreys But Clement ΙΙΙ. died in March, 1191, and therefore
could not have granted any privilege to Roger Norreys as Abbot.

It seems on the whole most likely that the substitution of the
name of Roger for that os Adam and the insertion of the words
“necnon . .. benedicendi '³ in the first of the three bulls in the
Cotton MS. are due to mistake on the part of the copyist, and
that the second bull which appears in the Cotton and Harleian MSS.

, was omitted in the Chronicle because it was not known, or was recog-
nised as a forgery. In this case, it would apparently follow that the
authority in question was first conferred by Pope Celestine 111.

in 1192, upon Roger Norreys and his successors, the other privi-
leges given by the same bull to the Abbots of Evesham having
previously been conferred by Pope Clement ΙΙΙ. upon Abbot Adam
personally. It may he rernarked that none of these bulls appear

in Coequelines' Bellorum Prioilegiorum ac Diplomatum Rornan-
orum Pontificum amplrssimo Colleetr'o, 1739-44. The forms

of benediction generally agree with those of the Sarum Manual,
the readirigs of which are here cited from Dr. Henderson's
edition in the Appendix to the York Manual. They may also be

. compared with those in the Exeter Pontifical edited by Mr. Barnes

, in 1847.

l. 29. Intende preces nostras et. The Sarum Manual and Exeter
Pontifical both read “Intende propitius ut.’' Compare the
“Benedictio ad casulam stolam et manipulum,'’ col. 53.

· l. 33. Omnesque ea utentes, etc. T he end of this benediction as it
stands in the text is evidently corrupt. The Sarum Manual and the
Exeter Pontifical both read (after “utentes ²²) “tuis mysteriis aptos
et tihi in ea devote et amicabiliter servientes gratos effici concedas.'’
Compare, however, the end of the “Benedictio ad casulam stolam
et manipulum,” col. 5 3.

Col. 52. l. 2. Benedietronem rapat de superma The Sarum Manual and
Exeter Pontifical have “benedictionem tuam accipiat.’' ,

l. 9. Cingulo etcum balteo. So also the ExeterPontifical. The Sarum
Manual omits “et’' ’

l. 13. llrr'rrrrterir'. Probably an error of the scribe, for “ministri''
which is the reading of the Sarum Manual and Exeter Pontifical.

l. rl‘l‘. E} fregere. 'The Sarum Manual and Exeter Pontifical have
nec rigore.'’

l. 24· Sacri mr'm'sterr'i. So also the Exeter Pontifical. The Sarum
Manual has ‘¹ mysterii.''

l. 28. Deus qui solis predicatoribus. The Sarum Manual reads
·‘ stolis ’² for “solis '’ and omits ‘¹ orari0,'' showing also a few other
variations of reading in this benediction. The Exeter Pontifical
omits the benediction.
