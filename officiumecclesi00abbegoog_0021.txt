xviii PREFACE.

regard to the forms of prayers sor particular persons which are
contained in these unnumbered leaves, it cannot be said that there
is anything in the sorrns themselves which would point to the
locality where they were written or employed: but their position
among forms for use in the monastery of Eveehasn rnay fairly be
thought to leave little doubt on this subject. In the printing os all
these portioris the same rules have been followed as in the printing
of the text os the Evesham book

With'regard to the extracts from the Chronicle and Registers os
Evesharn which will be found in the Notes, and in the second
and third portioris os the Appendix, and to the passages cited
above from the same sources, the case is rather different Here it
seemed sufficient to secure substantial accuracy, without aiming
at literal reproduction. The authority of the Editor of the Chronicle,
the Rev. W. D, Macray, seerned to be amply sufficient sor this
purpose with regard to the Chronicle itself, and to the passages
cited in his edition os the Chronicle from the Registers os Evesham
among the Harleian and Cotton MSS, For these passages, there-
fore, the edition of the Chronicle in the Rolls Series has been
followed. The other extracts from the Registers were taken, in
some cases, {rom the Monasticon Anglicanum, in others, in the
first instance, from a transcript os portioris os the Harleian
and Cotton MSS„ now included in the Gough collection in the
Bodleian Library. This transcript was made in the latter part os
the last century for Williarn Tindal, the author os a History os
Evesharn, who employed it in the preparation of his work,
translating some of the documents and printing in Latin some
others which he apparently did not think himself competent
to translate. The transcript, however, was evidently unsatisfac-
tory, some of Tindal's difficulties being obviously due to blunders
os the transcriber: and all the extracts taken from this source or
from the Monasticon A nglicanum have accordingly been compared
with the Harleian and Cotton MSS: the exact spelling and
punctuation os the MSS, is not followed, but errors and omissions
have been rnade good.

In conclusion, 1 would desire to express my thanks to those who
have kindly assisted me in my work or surthered the object with
which it was undertaken. In particular, those thanks are due to
Bodley's Librarian sor a ready consent to the transcription and
