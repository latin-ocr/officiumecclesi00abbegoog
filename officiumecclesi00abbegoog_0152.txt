Col. ι ¹4« l. 5. Benedictio. These benedictinus are not in the wm-
nnnster book, which after the collect ‘¹ Maiesmem tuam ’¹ hes (pre
ceded hy ‘⁴ Dominus uobiscum1'and “oremus ”) the two mllect:
which in the Eveehau· book follow the communion uf the siclt
brother (col. tro-rx) and the abach-uon ‘¹ Dominus Jesus Christus
qui beato” which the Evesham hook gives as oue of the absolu-
tiens said at the grave (col. ¹40)— Next follow the ‘¹ capitulum ¹¹
*⁴ Parce dor-nine '¹ (with n ruhric almost vahally the same as that in
the Evesham book col. ¹¹7) the litany, and the cummendation.

Col. τις. 1, xx. Amelmus mntuarimis episcopas, etc. There is nothing
in the Westmihsrer hook correspondingto this addition, which,
though written at [he end os the office, was duubtless intended
sor use at an earlier point in the visitationi.

Col. 116. l, 16. Post inunctionem, etc. These directions are rather more
minute than those in the Concordia Regulam} or in Lanfrane's
sstissgbo'glhere is nothing corresponding to them in the West-

l. ιδ. Samia et Iautndn'er The tailors’ moin and the laundry. A
similar direction, in more detail, which was followed at Croyland,
iscited hy Mar-rene (de Ant. Mon. ιω. Lib. vr mp. visi p. 249)

Cui. ω. 1. 41. Hisstmortuusfum't, etc, This mhn'c is not in the
Westminsrer hook, which, as already stated, joins the huhy and
the “ Commendatio animae ¹¹ (with the respond ¹¹ Subuenize '² and
the ³ Proficiscere anima christiana ”) to the order for the visitation
and unction.

Col, ιη, l. 35. Part hoc dqbortaetur corpur, ete. There is no corres-
ponding direction in the Westrninster book: according to its
rubncs the whole commendhtion would apparently be said before
the body was removed. The order in the Evesharn book rnore
nqearly agrees with §anfrands Statum. (Reyner, Apost. Benea'. in

noetumalibus.” “Staminia '¹ (also ¹¹ staminea n or ‘¹ stamineum ¹¹)
is the name of the fabric known as “linsey-wnolsey,” and is also
used, as here, of an undergarrnent made of this stuff. Lnnfranc's
