with the Evesham book in making no mention of the surplice.
The Winchester Pontifical‚ which, like the present Roman Ponti-1
fical‚ places the vesting at a later point, transfers also the prayer

“Adesto Domine,” which seems to referto this ceremony. ’

l. 19. Hic acceptas cassam‘is, etc. The Westminster book, like the '
Winchester Pontifical, directs that the hair is to be cut tante, with
the words “ In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti.’'

l. 23. Accipe personam, etc. This form does not appear in the
Winchester Pontifical‚ in the Westminster book, or in the present
Roman Pontifical. Its first words are noted bya later hand on
the margin of the Magdalen Pontifical, where the text directs that
the psalms “Conserva me ''- and “Domini est terra '' are to be
said (with the anthems given in the Evesham book) while the
tonsure is given. The Winchester Pontifical and the Westminster
book direct that the Bishop is to begin the psalm “ Conserva me ''
before giving the tonsure3 the psalm is to be said as far as
“Dominus pars‚'' and this verse is to be said by each of the
“ ordinati.'' After the tonsure is given the psalm is to be finished.
The Westminster book directs that all the “ tonsorati ” should
then together repeat the verse “Dominus pars‚'' and that the psalm
“Domini est terra'' with its anthem, should follow. The present
Roman Pontifical omits the latter part of the psalm “Conserva
me,'' and agrees with the Winchester Pontifical in placing before
“ Domini est terra ’' the collect “Praesta quaesumus '' (col. ²7 of
text), as to the position of which the Westminster and Evesham
books are in agreement. After “Domini est terra ’' in the
Winchester Pontifical, and in the present Roman Pontifical, comes
the vesting.

Col. ²7· l. ¹5- Presta quesumus, etc. After this prayer the Westminster
book directs that the tonsurati are to be sprinkled with holy water
and bidden by the Bishop to pray for him. A similar direction
stands at the end of the Orda in the Winchester Pontifical.

l. 22. Aa barbam tundendam. This form is not contained in the
Westminster book. It appears with but slight variation in the
Magdalen Pontifical.

Col. 28.1. 15. De professione nauicr'arum. The order here described for
the profession agrees as to its main features with that in the
Westminster book, but differs from it in some details, while both
show some variations from the order sketched in Lanfranc's
Statura. (See the Appendix to Reyner's Apost. Bcued. r'u Auglr'a,
pp. 244-5.) The Magdalen Pontifical contains a parallel office,
with the title “Benedictio Monachorum,’' but its rubrics are very
brief.

l. 16. Quando mauriti, etc. The rubrica of the Evesham book
contemplate the case of several novices making their profession at
the same time; but the prayers have apparently been copied from
a text which (like that of the Westminster book) was worded to

· suit the case of a single novice3 the plural terminations which,
