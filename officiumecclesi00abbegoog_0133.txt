l. 28. Dens qni potestate, etc. The marginal note in the MS.
(see font-note to text) may perhaps only be intended to refer
to the clause “Deus qui tam excellenti misterio ’': but it appears
as though it were intended to refer to the whole benediction.
The Westminster book has no mention of the omission either
of the benediction as a whole, or of the clause. The Sarum
and York Manuals and the Hereford Missal all direct the
omission of the clause in the case ofa second marriage. The
Samm Manual notes that the question (or rather, presumably, the
decision on the question) was brought to‘England in the year 1321 ;
by that date the Evesham and Westminster books were probably
already in use. ,

Col. 45. l. 17. Benedic domine hunc potum. The Sarum Manual and
Hereford Missal have this benediction (reading “panem istum
et hunc potum et hoc vasculum ''): the Westminster book has a
different form, the opening words of which arethe same as those of
the form in the Evesham book.

York Manual it forms part os an office for the “Benedictio
thalami.'' In the Sarum Manual and Hereford Missal it is
followed by the “Benedictio super lectum '' which is added in
the margin of the Evesham MS. and by the benediction
said over the bride and bridegroom: this last in the Sarum Manual
is broken into three benedictions, each preceded by “Oremus.''
The York Manual and the Westminster book do not eontain
either the “Benedictio super lectum '² or the triple benediction of
the persons.

Col. 46. l. 14. Benedictio peregrinorum. This order differs very widely
from that in the Westminster book, and also from the orders in
the Hereford Missal and the York Manual. It corresponds more “

nearly with that in the Sarum Manual, but the collects and bene-
diction do not appear in the same sequence as in the Sarum form,
iiiissteeiie preces in the Sarum form are much longer than those in

Col. 47. l. 11. Domine ilresn christe. This is the form of benediction

l. 37. In nomine domini. The forms used in delivering the staff and
scrip agree with the Sarum Manual. ,

Col. 48. l. 17. Omnipotens sempiterne dens. This (with slight varia·
tions) forms the last of the benedictions at the mass in the Sarum
Manual: it is the final benediction in the Westminster b00k3 and in
the Evesham book it appears again, col. 50.
