NOTES.

transformed into the one benediction of the fire on Easter Even in
connection with the “Benedictio cerei.’' (See Martene, dc Ant.
Mon. Rc‘t. Lib. III. cap. xiii. pp. 126-7.) The prayers oi the

χ rite in the Evesham book agree with those given in the Sarum
Missal (and nearly with those in the Westminster book) lor the
same purpose, in connection with the rite of the Paschal candle3
but they are not followed, as these parallel forms are, by forms lor
the benediction of incense, since this belongs to the blessing of the
candle. The fire is apparently in readiness when the Abbotcomes
to bless it; nothing is said as to its being kindled by means of a
flint or crystal, according to the usage mentioned in Mabillon's
Ordo Romanus, and in some of the passages cited by Martene: but
it is quite possible that this usage was lollowed at Evesham, though
the lact is not stated.

Col. 81. l. 37. Acccjocotqccod residuum fecerit, etc. The Hosts reserved
were sufficient in number for the communion ol the whole convent
on the next day (see col. 90, l. 1, 2). Martene (de Ant. Mon. crit.

Lib. ΙΙΙ. cap. xiii. p. 129) calls attention to the simplicity of the
ceremonial relating to the reservation in the monastic uses.
Lanfranc's Statura and the Concordia Regularc's mention the usage,
but the latter says nothing of any special place in which the Hosts
were deposited. According to the rubric of the Westminster book
the deacon carried the Hosts “curn summa reverentia inter duas
patenas: corporalibus honorifice inuolutas,'' and the Abbot laid
them in the place prepared.

Col. 82. l. 4. Interim denumcoaltare, etc. The washing of the altars,

. in the Westminster book also, follows immediately after mass, the
vespers oi the day not being joined to the mass, as in the
Sarum, York‚ and Hereford Missals, but said at a later hour. (See
col. 84 of the Eveaham book.) The Westminster book does
not contain the collects which are given iu the Evesham book,
col. 82-3. From Marthae, de Ant. Mon. Ro. Lib. III. cap. xiii.
pp. 1¹31·2, it is clear that both as to the mode oi this observance,
and as to its place in the ceremonies ot' the day, there was a con·
siderable amount of variation.

Col. 83. l. 10. Procedat prc'rcercs . . . . usquc refectorium. The refresh-
ment taken between mass and the ceremonial ol the rnaundy is
called by the name of ‘⁶ mixtum '' both in the Concordia Regularis
and in Lanfranc’s Statura. (Reyner, Apost. Bened. in Angl. App.
pp. 87, 220). The Westminster book does not refer to it, but
proceeds, after the washing of the altars, to the mention os the
“mandatum pauperum,'' with which it ends its directions lor the
day. But a note referring to another “ benedictionarium '' lor the
matters “ que hoc loco desunt ’' shows that the book does not at
this point give a full account of the order oi the ceremonies at
Westminster.

used during the last three days oi Holy Week, instead of a bell,
