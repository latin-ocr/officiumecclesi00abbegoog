point a direction that tvo belis are to be rung. Ther: follow
anthems, psaims, snd collem, apparently intended for a proces·

atter the benedictino and distributim of the ashes. In the rubrics
at me beginning οἱ the Ash Wednesday sectioni os the Westminster
book it is noted that the monks are not to go to the dormitory to
take ofl' their sandals, as they used to do when the processiorrwas
made “nudis pedibus? From this it may be inser-red (r) that the

processioni which follows the benedictior- οἰ the ashes: (²) that
the monks of Evesham, at the date oi this Ms. retained the
usage oi making the processioa “nudis pedibus '' which about
the same tii-ne had been already abandoned at Westminster.
