1207, and restored by Abbot Thomas de Marleberge, while Sacrist.
The same Abbot also made, at a later time, a throne for the shrine,
and an image of the saint which stood before it: the¹ whole edifice,
so completed, is called by the Chronicle “the chapel of St Wistan'’ 3
it was dedicated in 1233 by a Bishop John, who was at that time
acting as suffragan or commissary for various English Bishops. (See
Chron. Abb. de Evesh. pp. 83, 224, 266, 272, 2773 and the Ap·
pendix to the same work, pp. 326 sqq. 3 35-7.)

l. aa. Tumba sancti Wilsim'. St Wilsin or Wlsin (the name is spelt
both ways in the Barlow MS.) was also known as Wulsius or Wulsy.
He is most probably to be identified with an anchorite who spent
75 years as a recluse in different places, part of this time, apparently,
being spent at Evesham‚ where his relies seem to have been pre-1
served. (See Chron. Aba de Evesh. App. pp. 322-3.) This
identification is made practically certain by the fact that in the
Evesham kalendar in MS. Lansdowne 427, at Feb. 24th, there
appears the entry: Ι a

Hic obiit do· Wlsin' mo' et anachoreta istius loci.

His anniversary also appears in the list of “caritates '' in the Cotton
MS. Vespasian, B. XXIV. between the Feasts of the Purification and
the Annunciation. Neither the kalendar nor the list of “cari-
tates'' makes any mention of the festival of the better known
St Wulsin, Bishop of Sherbome‚ which fell on Jan. 8th‚ and the
possibility oi his being the same with the saint here mentioned
seems very slight It is noteworthy that although there wasa
special custom as to the colour of the vestments on St Wlsin’s Day
(see Appendix ΙΙΙ.) his name does not occur among those invoked
in the litanies in the Evesham book, though these include the
names of other saints locally venerated. We learn from the
Chronicle that until Thomas de Marleberge “ fecit lectricium retro
chorum, quod prius sactum nonest in ecclesia Eveshamiae’' the
lections were read “juxta tumbam sancti Wlsini.” (Chron. Abb.
de Evesh. p. 266.) The natural inference from the statement that
the lessons were read at the tomb would be that the tomb was in
the choir3 but the fact that the “lectricium '' afterwards made is
expressly said to have been “retro chorum '' suggests a doubt
whether the usage of Evesham on this point may not have been
exceptional
