Col⁴ 73. l. ¹9- Dicite quan acuistis. This interrogation nnd the answer
are notin the Westminsrer book or in either os the two Missals-
Their presence is sornewhat inconsistent with the long “postula-
πίοιμ’ which tus already been made.

phrase here has not been altered, as those in col. 71, 73 have been,

shortened surm of the “Conclusio’' The Sarum Missal gives the
absolution “Absolvimus vosu (see col. ⁶3 us the Evesham book) 3

latter, among the things to he said and done at the church door,
mentions the admonitioni to the penitens, leaving its delivery m

church door, The same practice is recognized in :he first of
Mabillon's Ordines Romani (Mus⁴ Ital. Vol. 11. p. Π) but this part
os the Orda is probably not os Roman on'gin, since the custom
was not known at Rome in the middle of the Sth centuryr This
appears from the reply of Pope Zacharias to a question on the
subject addressed to him by St. Boniface, ιι 751⁴ See Jaffe,
