is marked by catch-words connecting it with the next page. The
number of leaves in the gatherings is not uniforrn: the arrange-
ment may be shown summarily as follows, the gatherings being
indicated by letterS, and the figures showing in each case the
number of leaves in each of the gatherings preceding the
figure :-

abc¹² d⁸ e⁶f¹⁴ glr¹² θ klm¹2 71⁸.

This arrangement suggests that the book may have been made
up of three separate parts, each os which ended with a small
gathering. Thus the first part would end with the last page of the
gathering e (zie. with page 100), the second with the last page of
the gatheringz' (rie. with page 184), and the third with the last
page of the gathering n (ie. with page 272). This view is sup-
ported by the facts that page 100 is not full, that page 184 is blank,
and that page 272 contains more than the usual number os lineS‚
while the amount of abbreviations in the last few lines of the page ’
seems to indicate that the scribe was endeavouring to avoid the
necessity of carrying his writing on to another page. The three
gatherings which are not marked by catch-words are those which
end with these three pages. '

The contents of these three sections of the MS. are to a certain
extent distinct in character. The first section (pp. 1 to 100) con-
tains :—

(a) General directions as to the Abbot's part in the services,
and as to the forms to be observed when he is in the
Cloister, in the Chapterhouse, and in the Refectory.

(b) The order of making catechumens.

(c) The orders of conferring the tonsure, of the profession of

² monkS, and of the admission of lay-brothers.

(d) The Marriage Service.

(e) The form ο fthe Benedict t10n of Pilgrims.

(f) Various forms of benediction for part ticular purposeS,
including those for blessing ecclesiastical vestments

(g) Short benedictions for use before the lessons 1n the
nocturns throughout the year.1

¹ It seems not impossible that these Nocturn Benedictions have been added to utilize
blank leaves at the end of the portioris, in which they occur; they are in the same hand
as the rest of the MS„ but show an unusual amount of abbreviation, as compared with
other portions of the text.
