another. Some of the prayers of this order are found, with
variations of form, in one or other of the books mentioned: but the
arrangement of the service, as a whole, is so far removed from that

1. 30. Dt'uertant per altare sancti iohannis baptiste usquein creptam.
Perhaps the most notable peculiarity of the order of blessing the
candles observed at Evesham is the place in the church selected
for the performance of the rite. At Salisbury, York, Westminster,
and probably at Hereford‚ the benediction took place at the high
altar. At Evesham‚ it seems to have been performed in the crypt,
probably before an altar which is frequently referred to in the
Chronicle and other documents relating to the monastery as the
altar of St Mary ‘¹ in cryptis.'' As to the meaning of this term,
however, a doubt has been raised. May, in his “History of
Evesham '' (p. 48) contends that the “cryptae ’' were not the crypt,
or undercroft, but certain chapels at the east end of the choir, so
called from the vaulting of their roofs3 and Mr. Macray, in his
edition of the Evesham Chronicle, seems to adopt this view (Chron.
Aba de Everh. p. 348). May's chief argument seems to be that it
is incredible that the Ladychapel should have been in the crypt:
and the view that the “ cryptae ’' were separate chapels not under
but adjoining the choir, may perhaps be supported by certain
passages in the Chronicle, which speak of the works of restoration
carried out by Thomas de Marleberge, after the presbytery of the
church had been destroyed “ by the second fall of the tower.'' He
is said to have repaired the presbytery “cum tectis cryptarum
presbyterio adjacentibus (p. 265), while another passage states of
him :-“ Turres etiam presbyterii fecit, et quinque tabellata lapidea
super quinque tecta cryptarum, et illam partem ecclesiae quae
est super altare sancti Iohannis Baptistae reparavit post secundum
casum turris '' (p. 269). Another passage states of the same person
that he “quinque etiam arcus presbyterii et unum ante ostium
cryptarum obturavit.'' These passages suggest that the “cryptae ’'
were near the presbytery, and that the ‘⁶ five roofs '² of the “ cryptae ’'
were destroyed or damaged by the same fall of the tower which had
done much damage to the roof and walls of that part of the church.
May supposes that there was a Ladychapel to the east of the choir,
and that the masonry discovered to the east of the remains of the
undercroft during the excavations carried on by Mr. Rudge (333
Vetusta Monumenta, Vol. V.) was the foundation of this chapel.
Hence he infers that there would not be a Ladychapel in any
other part of the church. That there was a Ladychapel elsewhere
than in the undercroft isprobany true: for Abbot de Broke·
hampton (1282-1316) appears to have built one, if the statement
concerning himin the Chronicle (p. 286) refers to the making of a
new chapel, and not simply to the improvement and decoration of
one already existing. But it is not certain that de Brokehampton’s
work was completed when the Evesham book was written: and it
