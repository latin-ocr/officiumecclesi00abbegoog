l. 23. Impia! hanc Ietam'am. In the Weetminster book there is uo
litany nt this point, the Kyrie, Lord's Prayer, precer und collects
following directly uiuet the seven penlimr. The ‘¹Kyrieleyson,¹’
with which the Evesham litat-ty begins, was probnbly said either
twice or thrice: the alteration o( the numeral mentioned in the
font-note hss reduced the number os repetitions. Some of the
other invocatione of the limny are also marked with a numeral,
those, namely, which ste addressed to S‘ ngin und S* Benediet,
the founder os the monastery and the founder os the Order.

Col. 1051. ³3- Saum odulfi S‘ Odulr was a Canon of Utrecht³ who
died about the year 865. The Evesham Chronicle says that his
relim, consisting of the greater part os his remains, were purchnsed
for 100 marks by Aelward, Abhot os Evesham and Eishop of
London, frorn some merchants who had brought them to London
for sale. In an account of the translation and miracles of the
saint, contained in the same volume with the MS⁴ Chronicle, and
published hy Mr. Mau-ay in the Appendjx to his edition of that
work, it is stated that the relies were stolen by those who brought
them ro London, and that they were imported from “suumn''
(ιζ,Δ staveren, ιη Frieslami ς) wirne me price para to the thieves is
said to have been :hundred pounds. (chron. ΑΜ. de Evexh. p.
83, and App. pp. 313-14.) The relies so purchased were given
by Aelward to the monastery ο( Evesham, and were kept,
apparently, in a shrine which had been formerly occupied by the
relies of S* ngin⁴ The Chronicle says that Abbot Manny
(104459) made a shrine for the relies of Ξι Odulf, hut that he
considered the shrine to be so satisfactory when finished that he
dezermined to assign it sor the relies os S* ngin. (Chron. ΑΜ.
de Eveslr. p. ⁴4) The treatise on the miracles of S* Odulf
contains a curicus story, which may be connected with the trans-
lation of S'. ngin's relies from oue shrine to the other, and with
the employrnent os the older shrine for 5ι Oduls's relies. Ac-
cording to this tradition, the lady Edith, the consort of S* Edward
the Confessor, sent to many En lish monssteries to require the
monlrs to send the relies of their saints to Glouoester, in order
that she might make a selection for herself. The Evesham monks,
nster consultation, determined to send, not the relies of δ’. ngin,
but those of Sz Odulf. The lady Edith is said to have been
struck with blindness on attempting to open the shrine. and to
have heen restored on making a vow not to attempt any similar
promedirrg for ὼε tumre⁴ Tire renes were accordingly restored to
Eveshnm. See chron. ΑΜ, dr Evert. App. pp. 317-52) The
festival of s Odulr appears from the lists of ¹· caritates ‘¹ in the
Cotton MS, Vespasian, Β4 XXIV. to have been ohserved at Evesham
between June ist and June uth, and the kalendar in the Laus.
duwne MS. 4²7· places it on June reth, the same day on which it
appears to have been observed elsewhere.
