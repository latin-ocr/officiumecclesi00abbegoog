station took place not in the Chapter-house itself, but in the
entrance of the Chapter-house. In this case some word should be
inserted before “capituli''

l. 9. In scolis exparte laostilart'e. The church itself adjoining the
cloister on the north, and the Chapter-house lying on the east side,
it is probable that the schools were on the south or west : the last '
situation was apparently the most common: and the Chronicle, in
recording the benefactions of Abbot Ombresleye (1367-79) fur·
nishes a hint in favour of placing t'he school at Evesham in the west
walk. After stating that he built “ paginam illam claustri contiguam
ecclesiae ubi carolae fratrum consistunt '' (ie. the north walk)‚ it
mentions his outlay also “ pro alia '' (pagina sc.) “versus hostriam
sibi annexa.'' The “pagina versus hostriam'’ corresponds to the
“exparte hostilarie'' of the rubric: and it therefore seems that the
walk containing the school was one of the two next to the north
walk: while the rubric furnishes us with ground for thinking that it
was not the east. The “ hostria '² would ordinarily be placed to the
west of the cloister.

l. 15. Idriaquinta incana domini. The reconciliation of the penitents
like the eJection of the penitents on Ash Wednesday, seems to
have disappeared from the monastic rites in most cases. It is not
mentioned in Lanfranc's Statura or in the Concordia Regularzi, nor
does Martene mention it in his account of the monastic ceremonies of
Maundy Thursday. lt was probably retained, however, where the
ejection of the penitents was retained, and thus it appears in the
Evesham book, and also in that of Westminster. The Evesham order
is somewhat more elaborate than that in the Westminster book, and
than the orders in the Missals of Sarum and York, so far as regards
the introduction of the penitents to the church. The three sets of
preces, each followed bya collect, which appear in col. 73, 74, 75,
are not given in either of the Missals, or in the Westminster book.
There is nothing in the Evesham rubrics to show that the whole
series of preces and collects was not said at the church door, but it
seems more likely that, as the penitents on Ash Wednesday were
gradually driven out of the church, so they were on Maundy
Thursday gradually led back, being brought within the church door
at tlte first collect of the series, and gradually conducted by succes·
sive stages to the place between the choir and the altar where they
appear in col. 76.

l. 24. Precentoretr‘am. The Precentor appears at Evesham to have -
taken the part in this office which at York and Salisbury, and also
at Westminster, is assigned to the Archdeacon (see l. 38, and col.
73, l. 4). It is curious that although the rubric originally
mentioned the Prior as “postulating” on behalf of the penitents,
there is no direction as to his being vested. This is perhaps due
to the scribe‘s having copied from an older book which in all three

places made mention of “the Prior or Precentor,’' and having
omitted the mention of the Prior in the first place, to suit the
existing usage, but failed to make the corresponding alteration in
copying the later passages. (See col. 7 5, l. 39.)
