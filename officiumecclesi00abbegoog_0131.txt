184 NOTES..

“digito annulari dextrae manus sponsae, aut alii secundum
morem loci et personarum '' (p. 138), a regularion which suggests
that there may have been a good deal of variation in the local
usage.

(or the like) words aster the aet of placing the ring on the bride’s
hand and the words accontpanying that action. The Sarum and
YorkManuals and the Heresord Missal direct the corresponding
words to be said before the ring is given 3 the Hereford Missal
seems to lay especial stress on this point.

l. 29. Postea dz'catsacerdos, etc. See note on col. 36, l. 12. In the
order and form of these following benedictions at the church
door the texts cited show considerable variation, the Hanley
Castle Missal agreeing more closely with the Evesham book than
any of the others

l. 33. Omnt'potens sempiterne deus. This benediction does not appear⁴

the same position. In that MS. it begins “Deus qu1 primos.''

⁴ It appears also, with some variations, in the lrish Missal edited by
the Rev. F. E. Warren. (Afzssale VetusHiberm'cum, p. 83.)

Col. 38. l. 10. Et qui sea. This clause does not readily connect itself
with the words preceding, and it seems at least possible that
something has been omitted after “ uoluit,'’ or that “ et '² should
be omitted. The Hanley Castle Missal, however, agrees with
the reading of the text. The llfzisale Vetus Hibernieum has “et
qui dignatus est nasci de maria uirgine et suo presentatu miraculo
nuptias consecrare.'' ,

l. 16. Quietem temporis sanitatem. In the Evesham book, between
the words “quietam '' and “ temporis ’² there is aspace across
whicha line has been drawn, apparently by a later hand. The
Hanley Castle Missal substitutes “corporis’' for “temporis’'
Missale Vetus Hiberm'cum has “quieta tempora mentium et corporum
gaudium.’' ·

¹· Ἐκ {lt &libila 2 lltlthltlhtitillattirhtil}
York Manual and the Westminster boolr have, with variations, one
which slightly resembles it.

l. 38. Respice domine. This benediction appears at the same point in
the Westminster book aud in the Hanley Castle Missal. lt is found
among the benedictions said in the church in the Hereford Missal
and the York Manual, and also (in a slightly different form) in the

= Sarum Manual.

Col. 39. l. 8. Inde si sint iuuenes. The Westminster book also directs the
following benediction to be said “si adolescentes fuerint.’' But
there, as in the Hereford ‚Missal and the Sarum and York
