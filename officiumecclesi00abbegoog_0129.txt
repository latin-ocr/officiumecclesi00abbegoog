“Miserere ” as the one psalm in this place, not ‘having men-
tioned its use at the earlier point.

. i. 26. Deus indulgentie pater. This and the following prayers

{ceording' to the Westminster rubric “per modum lectionis plane
uantur.

Col. 31.l. 11. Nauicii iaceant in curta uent'a. See note on col. 7, l. 23·
This phrase does not appear in the Westminster book, nor is
it explained by any of the authorities to which reference has
been made. Its probable meaning may be inferred from certain
phrases in the Constz'tutzbnes Hirsaugienses (Vct. Dt'sc. Mon. p. 89)
where it is said that the novice, aiter the presentation of his
profession, “veniam super genua petit,'' and that those who
say the verse “Suscipe me‚'' “petunt ter veniam super manus et
genua.''

’ 1. 15. Sancte sparatus qui te. The Westminster rubric orders this
prayer to be said without “ Dominus uobiscum,'' but with “ Oremus,''
“legendo ut prius.''

Col. 32· l. 34. Aspergat cucullas, etc. The Westminster rubric directs that
the cowl is to be censed

Coi. 33. l. 5. Et conparant abbas. Τ1ιε Westminster rubric runs “con- ’
festim abbas capud nouicii caputio cooperiens osculatur.'' Lan-
franc's Statura place the weiling of the face of the novice after the
prayer “Deus misericors Deus clemens.'' Bernard of Cluui (Vct.
Dirc. Mon. p. 180) omits this prayer, and agrees with Lanfranc and
the Westminster book in joining the kiss with the weiling of the
face.

1. 11. Lauda z'erasalem. For this psalm the Westminster book sub

The Westminster book gives rather fuil directions as to the proces-
sion round the choir, ordering‚ among other things, that the Offer-

not have time to complete the circuitos the choir. (Vct. Dirc.
Mon. p 443). Bernardof fCluni says that the novice may be sent

into the choir either after the“ offerenda'⁷ has been begun, or before
the Creed (Vct. Dirc. Mon. p. 180).

l. 38. Procedant et recipiant osculum. Neither the Westminster
book nor Lanfranc's Statuta contains such a direction.

l. 4²· Et notandum, etc. The directions which follow are given in more

in Lanfranc's Statura: but the three agree in substance, so far
