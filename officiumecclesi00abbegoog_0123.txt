NOTES.

one or two psalma Kyrz'e, Pater noster, certain preces, audone or
more collects. These were said privately‚ immediately after com-
pline. Martene gives an example of their form in de Ant. Mon.
Rit. Lib Ι cap. xii. (p. 39 in ed. 1764) where he cites the
following passage from the Usus Baccanses. “Omnibus per annum
diebus post completam prius a pueris dein a reliquo conventu fiant
tres orationes3 aPascha usque ad octavam Pentecostes‚ et omnibus
festis per annum, et die ante festum, corpore tanturn inclinato
reliquo anni tempore genu interram deposito.'’

Col. 7. l. 9. Ewangelium legere, According to hlartene, de Ant. Mon. Rit.
Lib. II. cap. i. (p. 44 in ed.1764) the reading of the Gospel at
mattins was a duty belongipg to the Abbot; but the· custom had
{llll llll tillet.litifredi} lfglhalssllhle
Evangelii ex Regula pertinet ad abbatem, et tamen ex communi
ordinis usu Sacerdoti Hebdomadario commissa est.''

l. 23. Capiat paruum ueni. The reading of the text has been marked
with an “obelus '' not'because it is, but because it might easily be
supposed to be, an error of the scribe. The form “veni '² as a
masculine or neuter substantive is not noticed in Ducange‚ but it
occurs elsewhere in the Evesham book, though not in the body of
the text. It is found in the form for the Installation of an Abbot
which is contained in the unnumbered leaves at the beginning of

, the MS. (see Appendix Ι.) where “in curto ueni '² is evidently the
same in sense as “in curta uenia '' at col. 31 of the text. Thus
“capere paruum ueni ’' signifies “to make a slight. ‘reverence.’'’
Possibly a vernacular corruption of the word “venia'’ in the sense
of a “genuflection‚'’ or “reverence,'' into “venie'' or “veni'' has
been Latinized into the neuter or masculine substantive.

l. 30. Post inceptionem ymm Te deum. In the Ordo Clum'acenszs of
Bernard (in Vet. Dirc. Μοη. p. 182) 1t is laid down that the reader
of the Gospel should leave the ch01r at the verse“ Pleni sunt caeli,''
and having vest ted 1n alb, stole, and chasuble, shouldt ret urn at the
verse‘ ‘Per singulos dies,'' carrying the (1ospel book in the first
place to the altar, and thence to the “analogium '’ or reading-desk.

The useof mass vestments at mattins is noticed also by Martene
de Ant. Mon. Rit. Lib. Il. cap. i. ii.

Col. 8. l. 9. Analogium. The remainsof areading-desk found at Evesham,

possiblyt that here referred to, are described and figured in Archaeo
legra, 1814, Vol. XVII. p. 278.

l 16. Dicto oratione Ewangelmm Perhaps the word‘ ‘'’post or
“’'a‹l has been omit tted before‘ ‘Ewangelium'’ the oratio referred
to being the collect which' 1n the Benedictine rite follows the
Gospel lection at the end of mattins and is followed by the “Deus

' in adjutorium '’ which marlrs the beginning-of lauda

Col.9 ..l 19. Preparott'one colicas. Presumably this refers to the “making
9of the chalice‚'' andis another instance of the usage of mixing
before the beg1nn1ng of the Mass3 but the timeof the“ preparation''
is not stated explicitly.
