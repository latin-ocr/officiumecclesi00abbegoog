ALTARS ANB CHAFELS AT EVESHAMr 161

the stamlatian (September roth). For the consecration is mentioned
quite ιριη from thnt of the altar os δ’ John Baptlst on December ³¹³²
(the mormw ofthe Depositimt of Ξῖ ngin) while the Dedicatio Cryptamm
is mentioned in the Cotton MS. Vespasian Β, XXIV. (in a list of caritates prr
annum) after the Deeollation os 3² John Baptist and just before :he Octave
of S· ngin, which day is mentioned before the Feast of S‘ Matthew In
this case, the consecrationi os the Ladvthapel would have taken place

on September uth, ¹²9⁵<

From the Cotton MS, Nero D⁴ ΙΠΔ we have a record of the consecra-
tion of two more alters in the year ¹52²- un September 5111, hy Ralph,
Bishop ot* Asmlon. These were the altar of S2 ngin on the north side
of the nave, md an altar of the Holy Cross, opposite to it. At a much
eni-tier date, in ¹²³¹ or ¹²3²i Thomas de Marleberge made an altar of the
Holy Crass in »mvi cedma, perhaps the altar before the Roodlost.
(Chronicle, p. 276.) In the nave stood also the altar uf S‘ Thomas of
Canterbury (Chronicle, p, 307) and perhaps those os St Stephen (Chronicte,
p. ²99) and os the Holy Trinity (mentioned in MS. Harl. 3763). In the
sacristy there was an altar o( S2 Peter (see eoL 28) which was already in
existence when Thomas de Marleberge was Prior, tle, before 1229.
(Chre-atde, p, πμ.)

To the altars already mentioned must be added those which would
form part ot the chapels in which the feretra of S¹ ngin, S‘Odulf, 82
Credan, and S‘ Wiflmn were placed, and probably one at the tomb os
stwum. Possibly the two brachia os 8² ngin and S2 Oflwald, made hy
Abhot Reginam, between ιω and 1148 (Chronicle, p. 99) were chapels
wiflzin the church. and the same rnay be said of the chapel os S2 Nicholas,
buin between 1070 and 1077 by Abbot Agelwy. (Chronicle, p. 93.) The
chapel of 5¹ Mary Mngdalen, built by Abho: Maurioe, about ¹09⁶»
(Chroniele, μ 98) und that os ει Anne, reputed by Thomas de Marleberge
before 1229 (Chronicle, p. 271), seem to have been crepere adjoining the
'‘locutum'' and were probably not within the church. Other chapels
outside the thurch, but within the monastery, were that of ΞΕ Miehael in
the infirmary. dedicated in ¹233 (Chronicle, p. 277), and that. in the
Abho& lodging. (Chronicle, μ 288.)

Lu the oemetery which surrounded the great chureh were the two
chun-che- or chnpels of Ξι Laurence and All Saints. which sriu rel-nain. In
each of these churches there would most probably be at least nne almr.
Alto within the cemetery, near the Abbey gnte, stood the chapel known as
the carnarium or ‘¹ eharnel-house,¹¹ and adjoining this chapel¹ but outside
the gate, was a chapel built by Abbot John de Ombresley (1367-79) on
the extreme verge of the precincts, (Chronicle, p, 300.)

or the altars mentioned in me Manassae„ affricanum, in the passage
cited, thar of Constantine is perhaps imaginaryr 'she twelve altars ot· the
Apostles, which go to make up the toul of fifteen, probably have their
origin in the name given to one of the altars in the crypt, in the list of
altars consecute-i in 1²95- The memorandum including the mention of
this alm is printed in the Mannum, v01. Π, ρ, 34,s10m stevens, who
