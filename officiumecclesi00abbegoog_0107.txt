ALTARS AND CHAPELS AT EVESHAM-

Iu the Alonasticon Anglimuuffl (Vol. Η. p. 12) it is stated that the
church of Evesham “had fifteen altars. besides vhe high altar os Jerus:
viz, thore of the Virgin Mary, of the Twelve Apostles, Pope Constantine,
and 5² ngin: al! in their chnpelsfl There seems to be some confusion
herm and ir is perhaps worth while to give a somer-hat more complete and
exact list ns the ahars and chapels which mn be shown ιο have existed
within the monastery precincts.

In the church itsels. besides the high altar, there wu at leisc one alm
of the Blessed Vix-giu, and probably more thzn one, since oue is frequently
spoken o( ns the altar os 5² Mary in cryptis. This may he merely to dis>
tinguish the altar ofthe early Lady-chapel {mm the altar os the Lady-chapel
whienns itseemsffvss bussi by Abbot John de Brokehampton (1282*13164)
But it is possible that even before that Abbot’s time, there was an alm σί
S* Mary in the upper ehmcb, besides that in the crypt. (On the sense of
the terrn in cryptis see note nn eol. 57, 1. 30.)

From the Harleian MS. 37⁶³ it appears that on December xfith. ¹²95,
the church ot Evesharn was ‹eccncned hy the Bishop of Enngor (Anisn).
The muse which had rendered its reconeiliation necessary is not sured, and
the Chronicle does not give any infun-tration on the subject. After the
reconcifiation of the church several altas: were consecrated in ir bdore
the end of the year 1295, hythe Bishop οι S* Asaph (Leohne Emmfiehu
On the 17th December this Bishop consecrated four altars retra majm

On the zrsr December (S‘ Thomns' Day) he consecrated two altars r'n

had been dedicated in 1203 by Philip, Archbishop os Tuam. (See Chr-an.
