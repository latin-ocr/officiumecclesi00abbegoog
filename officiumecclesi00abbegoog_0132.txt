l. 25. Hic tradantur eis cmi. The Hanley Castle Missal is the
only one os the English texts cited which contains a similar direnion ς
but there the tapers are apparently delivered before the psalm ‘¹ Beati

the bride and bn'degxoum are to hold bnrning ἱερεῖς at the introit
os the mass which follows, and to offer them at the time of the obla

in a Rennes >Missa cited hy Manem <a Ant. Eccl. Rn.1.ib.1

Sarum and York Manuals and the westminster book, but not in the
Hereford or Hanley Castle Missals.

the Gradual.

York Manuals, and in the nereford Missal: the Wesuninster book
