of the remains of a meal gathered together to be bes'towed as alms.
There is no mention of this sense of the Latin word in Ducange.
For the use of the English word see the Descmptc'om ef tlte Rites of
Derdam (Surtees Society, 1842) p. 78 :-“Ther weare four aged
women who lyved in the Farmery without the South Gaits of the
Abbey of Durham being founde and fedd onely with the
releefe that came from the Priofs own meyss.''

Col. 18. l. 6. Ordo ad caticuminos faciendos. This Ordo agrees for
the most part with that in the Sarum Manual‚ but differs in some
respects both from that Ordo and from the Ordo in the York
Manual. It differs also from the parallel Ordo in the West-
minster book (Bodley MS. Rawlinson, C. 425).

l. 13. Interrcgetnomm infantis. The name is not demanded at this
point in the Sarum Mannal or in the Westminster book: but the
question is directed at the same point in the York Manual.

l, 15, Recede diabole, etc.‘ This first exorcism does not appear in the
Sarum Manual‚ and that in the York Manual is in a different form.
The Westminster book agrees with the text.

Col. 20. l. 40. Deus abraham, etc. Before this prayer the Westminster
rubrio directs that the child is to be signed on the forehead‚ and so

Col. 21. l. 30. Deus immortale presidium, etc. This prayer is directed
in the Sarum Manual to be said “sine OremuS‚'' and no “Oremus '’
precedes it in the York Manual. The later insertion of “sine ”
in the Evesham book seems to mark a change of use bothhere
and in the case of some of the prayers which follow, in which the
Manuals also direct the omission of “memus'' In the West-
minster book it is not clear whether the form “Or'' which

prpcedes some of these prayers, is to be regarded as more than a
t1t e.

Col. 221. l. 36. Exorm'smms smper masculos tantum. See note on col. 20,
. 40.

Col. 24· l. 20. Ad percipiendam.. . ‚mi Here the Westminster book
directs that the child is to be signed with its own hand: the
Sarum and York Manuals postpone this action till just before the
entrance to the church: the Evesham book omits it altogether.

l. ²4· Necte latet, etc. The Samm Manual agrees with the text in
making this adjuration follow the prayer “Aeternam ac justis-
simam.'' The York Manual ends that prayer with “Per Dominum,”
etc, and places before “Nec te latet '' the reading of the Gospel.
The Westminster book places before “Necte latet '' not only the
reading of the Gospel, but also the recital of Bater noster and
