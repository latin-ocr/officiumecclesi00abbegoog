his relics also by Abbot Manny (1044-59). The relies themselves
are said to have been subjected to the test of fise, along with the
relies of Sl Wistan (see note on col. 3, l. 21) by the Norman
Abbot Walter. (Chron. Aee. de Erash. App. p. 323.) The list
of “caritates medonum '' (or days when the convent had an allow-
anceo fmead) 111 the Cotton MS. Vesp. B. XXIV. places his festival
between the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin and the Feast of
St Bartholomew. The kalendar' rn the Lansdowne MS 427
marks rt on Aug. 19th.

Col. 105. l.7 37. Saluum fac sernum tuum, etc. The preces in the West·
minster book very nearly agree with those 111 the text, and are
followed by the first eight of the series of collects.

Col. 107. l. 33. Omnipotens sempiterne deus. This collect and the two
mh follow 11 313 1101 included in the series in the Westminster

Col. 108. l. ¹5· ffic dr'catinfirmus. Confiteor, etc. The corresponding

direction rn the Westminster book' rs as follows·- “Hie confiteatur

cunctis fratribus osculetur et interim hee collecte (1133111111.η Then

⁴ follow the four collects which rn the Evesham book precede the
direction as to the communicatingo 11113 sicli brother.

Col 110. l. 20. Hic communicetur etc. No portion of the text relating
to the communion o tfhe sick brother appears at this point in the
Westminster book, 1n which, after the collect‘ ‘Deus humani
generis, there follows(wrth Dominus uobiscum and ‘'Oremus ’)
the prayer preparatory to the unction(“ Omnipotens sempiterne
deus qui per beatum' 'l and the directions for anointing The
Sarum and York Manuals place the communion of the sick person
after the anointing, andin the Westminster book (which does not
mention the actual communion at all) the collects which follow
the communion in the Evesham book are placed after the anointing.
The Westminster usage, therefore, probably agreed with the order

of the two Manuals, which is also the order contemplated in
Lanfranc's stanna and 1n the Concordia Regulam's.

l. 41. Omnipotens sempiterne deus salus, etc. This prayer and that
which follows itare 111 the Westminster book placed after the
anointing. (See last note)

Col. 112. l..9 Per estam nmtiemm, etc. In the Westminsterbook the
words used at the anointing are all put together' 111 3 single form,
with the response ‘ Amen.’' The words‘ ‘Per istam unctionerri

,peccasti'’ are only written once, and there' rs no indica-

11011 that they were intended to be repeated: nor are there any
