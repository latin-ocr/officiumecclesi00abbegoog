202 NOTES.

Col. roo. l. 4. Ad matrinas. For the various uses of different monastic
communities as to the mattins of this night see Martene dc Ant.
Mon. ait. Lib. Ill. cap. xvi. pp. 145-7. According to Lanfranc's
Statura “the whole office ’' is to be sung “more monachorum,''
(Reyner, Apost. Bencd. in Argi, App. p. 224): the usage, how-
ever, of having only three lessons, seems to have been common,
and is recognized by the Concordia Reguloris (Reyner, App. p. 89).
The abridgement of the Concordia Reguloris, which represents,
apparently, the usage os Winchester, here agrees with the direc-
tions in the Evesham book, not mentioning the peculiar dramatic
rite which is found in the Concordia itself, and to which Martene
(p. 146) calls special attention. (See the Obcdicntiory Rolls of S‘
ch'tlrun's, Wnclrcstcr, p. 189.) Of this rite, perhaps the verse
“Surrexit dominus uere,’' before the beginning of lauds, may
be a remnant. In the mattins of this night there was no Gospel
lesson after Te Deum, but this fact does not account for the
phrase “in vi.festis” at col. 7, l. 29, since the same mle applied
to Pentecost‚ and therefore, if the writer had intended to deduct
from the number of the “Seven Feasts” those on which no
Gospel was read, the remainder would have been not six, but
live.

l. ³⁶· Et notandum quod obbas, etc. Martene (dc Ant. Mon. Rit. Lib.
III. cap. xvi. p. ¹49) notes this as an ancient custom‚ and citeS,
from the consuetudines of S. Pierre sur Dive, a passage resembling
thpt in the Evesham book, with reference to the Abbot's receiving
a enediction.

Col. 101. l. 3. Benedictiones in festo omnium sanctorum. lt seems
possible that the page on which these benedictions now stand,
forming, as it does, the end of the second section of the MS. ·
was originally intended to be lest blank, and afterwards utilized
by inserting them3 but the handwriting of the benedictions seems
to be the same as that of the body of the MS. One benediction
for the third nocturn has been left out: it is of course impossible
to say how the omission should be supplied, since it may have
been due to the intentional rejection of the form given in the
book from which the series of benedictions was taken, and thus
could not be made good with certainty even from a set of bene·
dictions exactly corresponding with the others in the tertt

l. 32· Ordo od uc'sc'tondum, etc. The order for the visitation and
anointing of the sick given in the text, while containing, as might
be expected, a good deal which is also to be found in the
Sarum and York ManuaIS, agrees more closely with the Westminster
book than with either of them. ln the Westminster book, how-
ever, the officiant is throughout this portion described simply as
“ sacerdos ’': in the Evesham book the Abbot, or failing him the
Prior, or Sub-prior, or (apparently in the last resort) another priest
is to fulfil the office.

Col. 102. l. 7. Alba. stola. et capa. The Westminster rubric omits the
eope, mentioning the alb arrd stole.
